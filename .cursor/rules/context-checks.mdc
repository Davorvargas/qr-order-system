# Context Checks Before Action

- Before making changes or diagnosing issues, the agent MUST:
  - Review the current database schema and architecture (tables, columns, relationships).
  - Check all relevant Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for the affected tables.
  - Review recent Vercel deployment feedback and logs for errors, warnings, or build issues.

**Example:**  
If a UI change is not reflected in production, the agent should:

1. Check if the deployment succeeded in Vercel and review logs for errors.
2. Confirm that the database schema matches the expected structure.
3. Verify that RLS policies allow the intended operation for the current user/role.

**Rationale:**  
This ensures the agent always operates with full, up-to-date context, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and wasted effort.
