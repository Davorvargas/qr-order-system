# Multi-Printer System Rules

- All printer interactions MUST go through the printer service layer (e.g., `printer_service.py`).
- Printer assignment logic MUST be stored in configuration or database, NOT hardcoded.
- Print jobs MUST be queued and processed asynchronously.
- Printer errors MUST be logged and retried; escalate if all retries fail.
- Printer status SHOULD be monitored and visible in the admin dashboard.
- Only authorized users/processes may send print jobs.
- Adding/changing printers MUST be possible via configuration, not code changes.

**Example:**  
To add a new kitchen printer, update the printer configuration file or database table, then restart the printer service. No code changes required.

**Rationale:**  
This ensures reliability, maintainability, and security for all printing operations.
