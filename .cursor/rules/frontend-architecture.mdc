# Frontend Architecture Rules

- Public-facing routes identifying a resource (like a table) MUST use a UUID, e.g., `/menu/[tableId]`.
- Server Components (no `"use client"`) SHOULD be used for admin/data pages to ensure data freshness and avoid caching issues.
- Client Components (`"use client"`) SHOULD be used for highly interactive pages (e.g., customer order form).

**Example:**  
The customer menu page at `/menu/[tableId]` is a Client Component, while the admin menu management page is a Server Component.

**Rationale:**  
This ensures security, scalability, and a smooth user experience.
