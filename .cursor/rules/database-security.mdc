# Database Security & Architecture Rules

- All tables with restaurant-specific data (e.g., `menu_items`, `orders`, `tables`, `menu_categories`) MUST have a `restaurant_id` column referencing `public.restaurants`.
- Row-Level Security (RLS) MUST be enabled on all tables containing sensitive or multi-tenant data.
- For every table with RLS, explicit `CREATE POLICY` statements MUST be defined for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
- The `is_admin()` function SHOULD be used for admin-level access policies.
- All schema changes (tables, columns, policies) MUST be made via Supabase migration files, NOT manual dashboard edits.

**Example:**  
When adding a new table for staff schedules, include a `restaurant_id` column and enable RLS with appropriate policies.

**Rationale:**  
This ensures data isolation, security, and maintainability as the project grows.
