- Critical business logic (e.g., placing an order) MUST be handled in Edge Functions.
- After any change to an Edge Function, it MUST be redeployed using `npx supabase functions deploy [function-name]`.
- Edge Functions MUST validate input and enforce business rules server-side, not just in the frontend.

**Example:**  
The `place-order` function checks the `table_id`, fetches the correct `restaurant_id`, and inserts the order with all necessary context.

**Rationale:**  
This centralizes business logic, improves security, and ensures consistency.
